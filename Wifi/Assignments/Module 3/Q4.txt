4. What is the significance of OFDM in WLAN? How does it improve performance?

   OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) splits signals into multiple subcarriers.

   Benefits:

           - Higher throughput

           - Resilient to multipath fading

           - Efficient spectrum usage
