12. How is the data rate calculated?

   Data Rate = (Number of bits per symbol × Symbol rate) × Coding rate × Number of streams
   Factors:
     - Modulation type (QAM level)
     - Channel bandwidth (20/40/80/160 MHz)
     - Number of spatial streams
     - Guard interval
     - Coding rate (e.g., 3/4, 5/6)
