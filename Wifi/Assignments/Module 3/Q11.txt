What is PPDU?

   PPDU (Physical Protocol Data Unit) is the transmission unit in the PHY layer.
   It carries control and data information.
   Types:
     Data PPDU – Carries user data.
     Control PPDU – Used for control signals.
     Management PPDU – Used for management frames.

PPDU Frame Format Across Wi-Fi Generations

    Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n)
        Modulation: OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)
        PPDU Structure:
            - Preamble
            - PLCP Header (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol – includes data rate, frame length)
            - MAC Header (contains addressing and control information)
            - Data (Payload)
            - Tail (Padding for alignment)


    Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)
         Modulation: OFDM, supports up to 256-QAM
         PPDU Structure:
            - Short Preamble
            - PLCP Header
            - MAC Header
            - Data
            - Tail
