6. What is the role of Guard Intervals in WLAN transmission? How does a short Guard Interval improve efficiency?

  - Guard Interval separates OFDM symbols to avoid inter-symbol interference.

  - Shorter intervals (400ns vs 800ns) improve efficiency and increase data rates by reducing wait time between transmissions.
