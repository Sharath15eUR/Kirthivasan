2. What are DSSS and FHSS? How do they work?

    DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum): Spreads signal using a pseudo-random noise code; improves resistance to interference.

    FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum): Signal rapidly hops across frequencies in a predefined pattern to avoid interference.
