3. How do modulation schemes work in the PHY layer? Compare different modulation schemes and their performance.

      Modulation encodes digital data onto a carrier wave.

        Common types:

          - BPSK (1 bit/symbol)

          - QPSK (2 bits/symbol)

          - 16-QAM (4 bits/symbol)

          - 64-QAM (6 bits/symbol)

          - 256-QAM (8 bits/symbol)

        Higher modulation = higher data rate but more sensitive to noise.
