2. Describe CAPWAP, explain the flow between AP and Controller

   CAPWAP (Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) is a protocol used to manage and control APs via a central WLC.

   It establishes two tunnels: a Control tunnel for management and a Data tunnel user traffic.

   Flow:

      AP boots → discovers WLC via DHCP, DNS, or broadcast

      CAPWAP control tunnel is established → AP is provisioned

      CAPWAP data tunnel carries client traffic to WLC
