1. Brief about SplitMAC architecture and how it improves the APâ€™s performance

     SplitMAC divides the MAC layer functions between the Access Point (AP) and the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).

      - Real-time functions like client association, beacon generation, encryption/decryption are handled by the AP.

      - Non-real-time functions like association, authentication, mobility management are managed by the WLC.
