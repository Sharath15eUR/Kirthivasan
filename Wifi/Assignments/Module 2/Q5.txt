5. How is the CAPWAP tunnel maintained between AP and controller?

   The tunnel is maintained using UDP port 5246 (control) and UDP port 5247 (data).

   Keepalive messages and heartbeat signals ensure connectivity.

   If the WLC goes down or the tunnel drops, the AP can switch to standalone or failover mode if supported.
