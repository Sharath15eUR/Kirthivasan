Different vlan communication 
    I have taken 4 pc and two switch and i  connected the switch using trunk port.
    when i try to ping from vlan 10 of switch 1 to vlan 10 of switch 2 the ping is sucessfull but when i try to ping from vlan 10 to vlan 20 the ping becomes unsucessfull.
    Because there is no vlan rouyting is created using router as vLANs cannot communicate by default because they are separate broadcast domains so we need a Layer 3 device like roter for communication between vlans.
