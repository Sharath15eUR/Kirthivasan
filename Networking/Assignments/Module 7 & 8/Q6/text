VLAN 
  It is use to split the lan network into small small parts to reduce flooding and to protect the data .
  If we are trying to connect two different vlan we need a common native vlan to carry the untagged traffic in the trunk port
  When we have two  differnt native valn for the netweok device then the traffic will not be send due to vlan mismatch
  To avoid this we need to configure the switches with same native vlan then we can able send the traffic to the other vlan
